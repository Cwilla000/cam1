# IllusionEngine

**Elevate your desktop with custom, interactive widgets**

Unlock a whole new level of desktop customization. Powered by Electron, IllusionEngine empowers you to unleash your creativity by building your own desktop widgets using familiar web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Want a live weather feed? Done. Need a quick-access app launcher? Easy.  With IllusionEngine, the possibilities are nearly limitless.

## Key Features
